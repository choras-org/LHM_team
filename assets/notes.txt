+ An option to see which material is assigned would be nice,
+ Surface naming could be editable
+ Colors of the surfaces according to absorption (eg. according to: https://odeon.dk/pdf/Claus%20Lynge%20Christensen,%20Visualising%20acoustic%20surface%20properties%20using%20colours.pdf)
+ Selecting multiple surfaces at once
+ Categories for assigning materials


+Impulse response length should be grayed out while simulation length is based on EDT

+ Initialisation should be a part of a progress,
+ It should be written what is being done

+ When the simulation is running, it is not possible to see the material properties
+ Material library is locked from scrolling to custom material properties,

+ When the simulation was running, opening the material library caused the progress bar to stuck.

+ Setting a characteristic length was not saved in json. (When duplicating the previous setting, the new one was not there)


+Issues with cancelling simulation:
 - interface still says it is running,
 - no message in backend that the simulation stopped
 
 
 + The properties for the materials (and sources and receiver positions) should be different from the simulation
 
 
 + Changing the simulation does not refresh the setting page. (It refreshes after changing to Surfaces tab and returning back)
 
 + A nice feature would be to examine the absorption coefficients for each material and also to see how each surface contribute to overall absorption
 +It would be nice to edit the material properties or create new one based on existing.
 
 +The downloaded simulated file should have a name of te simulation, but saves as "simulation-{number}'.
